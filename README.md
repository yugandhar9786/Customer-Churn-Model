# Churn Model MLOps Demo

A simple demonstration of MLOps practices for a customer churn prediction model.

## What Does This Model Do?

**Real-World Example:**

Imagine you run a telecom company with thousands of customers. Some customers are happy and stay for years, while others leave (churn) after a few months. This model predicts which customers are likely to leave.

**Example Customer:**
- **Sarah** is 45 years old
- Been a customer for 24 months
- Pays $79.99/month
- Total spent: $1,920
- Called customer support 3 times this month

**Model Prediction:**
```json
{
  "churn": 1,
  "churn_probability": 0.73
}
```

**Translation:** Sarah has a **73% chance of canceling her subscription**. Why? She's calling support frequently (unhappy) and paying relatively high fees. Your business can now:
- Offer her a discount
- Reach out with personalized support
- Prevent losing her before she leaves

**The model looks at patterns** like:
- High monthly charges → More likely to churn
- More support calls → Customer is frustrated
- Low tenure → Haven't built loyalty yet

This helps businesses **save customers proactively** instead of reacting after they've already left!
